      "message": "One example of a scenario to consider here (not making a judgment about it, myself):\n1. User has non-persistent MAC address randomization enabled (safer/safest/whatever).\n2. User is connected to flaky hotel Wi-Fi and trying to participate in a meeting.\n3. After some tweaking, everything seems to be going fine.\n4. User randomly (unrelated to this change) gets disconnected after 30 minutes or so but is automatically reconnected.\n\n* New behavior: User will have a new MAC address and need to deal with the captive portal again, delaying their re-entry to the meeting.\n* Old behavior: User will have the same MAC address and possibly not need to deal with the captive portal again, so they are able to re-join their meeting more quickly, unless their MAC address was last changed more than 24 hours ago.",
